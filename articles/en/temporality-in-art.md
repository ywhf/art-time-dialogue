# Temporality in Art: A Dialogue Between the Eternal and the Momentary

*Author: Evelyn Thorne*

## Introduction

Time is the most universal yet most elusive dimension of human experience. We live within it, are shaped by it, yet cannot truly grasp it. Art, as a medium through which humans express and understand the world, has engaged in a dialogue with this dimension throughout history. From the pursuit of eternal beauty in classical sculptures to the capture of fleeting moments in modern photography, artists have continuously explored how to express flowing time through static media, how to transform momentary experiences into lasting meaning.

This essay will explore different understandings and expressions of temporality throughout art history, from the Renaissance pursuit of eternal beauty, to the Impressionists' capture of ephemeral light, to the modern and postmodern exploration of fragmented and subjective time. Through this journey, we will not only see the evolution of artistic expression but also gain deeper insight into the changing human perception of time.

## I. The Pursuit of the Eternal: Classical Art and Time

### Transcending Time through Ideal Beauty

Greek and Renaissance artists pursued an ideal beauty that transcended time. They believed beauty existed in eternal forms and proportions, and that art's mission was to capture this timeless truth. Michelangelo's "David" is not merely the image of a figure at a specific moment, but an eternal exemplar of the perfect human body. This artistic view regarded time as a limitation to be transcended, rather than a subject to be expressed.

As art historian E.H. Gombrich stated: "The classical artist sought not to represent a specific moment, but to express eternal truth through perfect form." This pursuit of the eternal is embodied in rigorous geometric proportions, idealized human figures, and static compositions, as if attempting to freeze flowing time into an eternal moment.

### Narrative Time and Compressed Time

However, even within the classical tradition that pursued the eternal, artists developed techniques to express the flow of time. Raphael's fresco "The School of Athens" brings philosophers from different eras together in a single space, creating a compressed temporal narrative. Roman reliefs often employed continuous narrative techniques, presenting different stages of a story within a single frame, as seen in the reliefs on Trajan's Column depicting a series of war scenes that are temporally sequential but spatially juxtaposed.

This narrative approach to time demonstrates early artists' recognition of temporal complexity and their creative attempts to express the flow of time in static media. Even within an artistic tradition pursuing eternal ideals, the fluidity of time was acknowledged and expressed in specific ways.

## II. Capturing the Moment: From Baroque to Modernism

### The Decisive Moment: Baroque's Dramatic Instants

Baroque art began to focus more on expressing specific moments, particularly climactic moments of emotion and action. Bernini's "David" forms a striking contrast with Michelangelo's work—the former captures the moment of stone-throwing, full of tension and dynamism; the latter is a static, contemplative figure. Caravaggio's dramatic use of light and shadow emphasizes the emotional intensity of specific moments, as in "The Calling of St. Matthew," where light suddenly illuminates the tax collector Matthew.

Art historian Heinrich Wölfflin observed: "Baroque art no longer seeks static perfection, but turns toward the dramatic tension of the moment." This shift reflects a change in the understanding of time, beginning to value the emotional power and narrative force of specific moments.

### Impressionism: The Flow of Light and Time

Impressionist artists pushed interest in specific moments to new heights, focusing not on dramatic events but on subtle moments of changing light in everyday scenes. Monet's "Haystacks" series and "Rouen Cathedral" series present the same subject under different times and lighting conditions, directly making time a central theme of artistic exploration.

Impressionist painters abandoned traditional studio painting methods, opting instead to quickly capture the ever-changing effects of light outdoors. This creative approach itself contained an attitude toward time: art was no longer a lengthy pursuit of eternal truth, but an immediate record of ephemeral experience. As Monet said: "For me, a landscape is like a human face, changing with the light of day."

### Photography and the Decisive Moment

The invention of photography provided an entirely new medium for capturing time. Henri Cartier-Bresson proposed the concept of the "decisive moment," believing that the essence of photography lies in pressing the shutter at the right moment to capture the instant of maximum visual tension and meaning. His work "Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare" captures the precise moment of a person jumping over a puddle, freezing time at its most expressive instant.

As a medium inherently related to time, photography intensified art's recognition of the value of specific moments. Roland Barthes observed in "Camera Lucida" the paradox of photography: it is simultaneously proof that "this has been" and a lament for the passing of time, both record and memory.

## III. Deconstructing Time: Modern and Postmodern Art

### Cubism: The Experience of Simultaneity

In the early 20th century, Cubism radically changed the expression of time in art. Picasso and Braque were no longer satisfied with capturing single moments, but attempted to present a synthesis of multiple time points and multiple perspectives in the same image. Works like "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" and "Three Musicians" broke the limitations of traditional single viewpoint and single moment, creating a visual experience of "simultaneity."

This mode of expression was influenced by Einstein's theory of relativity and Bergson's philosophy of time, reflecting the challenges to the concept of linear time in modern science and philosophy. Art no longer merely represented what we see, but how we experience the world through time and space.

### Futurism and Temporal Dynamics

Italian Futurism addressed temporal dynamics even more directly as its core concern. Boccioni's sculpture "Unique Forms of Continuity in Space" and Balla's painting "Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash" attempted to express the continuity of movement through overlapping and transforming forms, incorporating time as a visible formal element in their works.

The Futurist Manifesto proclaimed: "A running horse has not four legs, but twenty." This exaggerated expression reflects their rebellion against traditional static art and their obsession with the rhythm and movement of modern life. As industrialization and speed became central to modern life, artistic expressions of time correspondingly focused more on dynamics and change.

### The Rise of Time-Based Art: Performance, Installation, and Video

In the latter half of the 20th century, time itself became a direct medium for many art forms. Performance art, action art, video art, and installation art no longer viewed time as an element to be represented in static media, but made duration and change essential components of the work itself.

Marina Abramović's "The Artist Is Present" lasted three months, with visitors able to sit face-to-face with the artist, indefinitely extending the temporal dimension of the artistic experience. Andy Warhol's "Empire" is an 8-hour film of the Empire State Building, challenging the audience's patience and perception of time. John Cage's "4'33"" defined the ambient sounds during a specific time period as music, directly making time itself the content of art.

These works no longer attempt to capture or represent time, but let the audience directly experience time itself. As art critic Rosalind Krauss stated: "Modern art has shifted from 'objects in space' to 'experiences in time.'"

## IV. Digital Age: Fragmentation and Non-Linearity of Time

### Digital Media and Non-Linear Time

The emergence of digital technology has brought entirely new possibilities for temporal expression in art. Bill Viola's video installations, such as "The Quintet of the Astonished," extremely elongate or compress time, creating an experience that transcends natural temporal sensation. Digital interactive art allows viewers to participate in the construction of time, making each person's experience a unique timeline.

Internet art further deconstructs linear time, creating hypertextual and networked temporal experiences. Rafaël Rozendaal's "Natural Internet" series creates a continuously evolving digital ecosystem where time is both real (updating in real-time) and artificially constructed (controlled by algorithms).

### Memory and Archive: Postmodern Temporality

Postmodern art's focus on history and memory reflects a new conception of time. Christian Boltanski's installation "Monument" collects thousands of photographs of ordinary people, creating a contemplative space about collective memory and forgetting. Gerhard Richter's "Atlas" series juxtaposes fragments of personal and collective history, blurring the linearity of time.

This focus on memory and archive reflects the postmodern skepticism toward grand narratives and a fragmented, non-linear understanding of history. Art no longer attempts to create the eternal or capture the momentary, but explores how we construct temporal experience itself through memory and culture.

## V. Conclusion: The Ongoing Dialogue Between Art and Time

From pursuing the eternal to capturing the moment, to directly using time as a creative medium, art's expression of time reflects profound changes in how humans understand and experience time. This evolution reflects not only changes in artistic forms and techniques but also transformations in philosophical thought, scientific understanding, and social experience. The Renaissance pursuit of the eternal embodied that era's longing for order and stability; the Impressionists' focus on the moment reflected the accelerated rhythm of life in the industrial age; and the fragmentation of time in digital art echoes our contemporary lifestyle of divided attention and multitasking.

However, throughout art history, we can also see certain eternal questions: How to represent movement in stillness? How to make the ephemeral enduring? How to give shared meaning to personal temporal experiences? These questions form the core of the dialogue between art and time, spanning different eras and styles.

Perhaps the greatness of art lies precisely in this: it can both reflect a specific era's understanding of time and transcend eras to create temporal experiences with lasting appeal. Whether Michelangelo's "David" or Bill Viola's digital installations, they invite viewers into an experience different from everyday temporal sensation, prompting us to reconsider our relationship with time.

In this increasingly fast-paced world, art's various expressions of time remind us that time is not merely numbers on a clock or dates on a calendar, but also the quality of experience, the depth of memory, the construction of meaning. Through art, we learn to engage with time in different ways—sometimes pursuing the eternal, sometimes cherishing the moment, sometimes questioning linearity, sometimes embracing change.

The dialogue between art and time continues, with each new art form and medium adding new dimensions to this conversation. In the future, as technology develops and society changes, artists will continue to explore the mysteries of time, and these explorations will continue to enrich our understanding of this most fundamental yet most mysterious dimension.
